I have created a few classes to make the code easier to understand .

Main - the most important class where everything happens , also the main method is included
Boat - the class containing the description of a boat's characteristics
Boats - a class containing all boats existent 
Crew - a class containing all team members existent 
Member - the class containing the description of a member's characteristics
Move - the class containing the description of a move's characteristics
Moves - a class containing all moves existent 
Sorter - a class that sorts boats either by name in ascending order , or by offset of finish arrival in ascending order
SorterMember - a class that sorts members either by name in ascending order , or by years of experience in descending order
File - used for read and write


I considered that args[0] is the filename and then i modify it with a StringBuffer to add the .in and .out
